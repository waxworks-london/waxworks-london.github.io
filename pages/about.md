## The story

My jewellery journey began in 2017 when, tired of buying pieces that tarnished or broke after just a few wears, I decided to learn more about how jewellery is made, hoping to create my own pieces one day.

An introductory course in silversmithing and soldering got me hooked right away. In 2018, I moved to my hometown of Barcelona and decided to join a local jewellery studio. Every week I explored different techniques, building my skills bit by bit. It was here that I discovered my favourite technique: wax carving—a wonderfully peaceful and rewarding craft.

At this point, having worked in the events industry for several years, I started thinking seriously about turning my creative passion into something more. When the pandemic arrived in 2020 I launched Juno Jewellery, focusing on bespoke pieces that I mainly created through wax carving. Working from my tiny home studio with just a handful of tools taught me something important: you don't need a fancy setup to create beautiful wax-carved jewellery—just a table, a chair, and a few basic tools.

After the pandemic, I went back to managing events full-time but kept Juno Jewellery going for commission pieces. While organising away days and seasonal parties for corporate clients, I noticed something: we were all a bit tired of the usual team-building activities. Pottery classes, cooking workshops, candle-making and escape rooms—we'd all done them countless times. That's when it hit me: jewellery making could offer something fresh and different. It's a chance for teams to get creative, boost their confidence and make something truly personal they can wear with pride or gift to someone they love. Plus, there's nothing quite like the feeling of accomplishment when you finish making your very own piece of jewellery!
