Introduce your team to the art of wax carving, a unique, stress-relieving activity that sparks joy and creativity.

During our session, participants will design a piece of jewellery in wax, which we will then cast in silver, polish and deliver back to you finished to perfection.

## Sustainability & ethics

All jewellery made at our workshops is cast in recycled silver at local casting studios. We then polish and finish each piece by hand at our studio.


## Location

We can bring our jewellery making workshops to your space, co-working, event venue or retreat location. If you don’t have a location but would still like to hire our services, talk to us about hiring a suitable space.

## FAQ

### What are the venue requirements?

- A well-lit room
- Tables and chairs for all participants
- Approximately 24 inches of workspace per person for comfortable creating

### What is the maximum number of participants?

We aim to cater for any group size, but we want to ensure everyone gets the attention they deserve!

For larger groups, we provide an additional jeweller for every ten participants at no extra cost to give you the best possible experience.

Don't have space for everyone at once? No problem! We can either:

- Split the group across different rooms
- Arrange multiple sessions to accommodate your entire team

### How safe is this?

We take your safety seriously! Wax carving is a safe and fun activity, but we ask that your group acts responsibly around tools. We hold a Level 2 Health & Safety in the Workplace certificate and Public Liability Insurance.

### Can participants drink alcohol?

Yes, you can enjoy a drink while creating! We simply ask that participants limit themselves to one alcoholic beverage to ensure everyone can create their best work safely.

### What about the mess?

We'll take care of cleaning up any materials, wax scraps etc related to the workshop activities. We just ask that the room is booked for an extra 20 minutes after the workshop has finished so we can return the space to its original condition.
