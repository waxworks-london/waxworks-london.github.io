## The story

My jewellery journey began in 2017 when, fed up with buying pieces that tarnished or broke after just a few wears, I decided to learn more about how jewellery is made, hoping to create my own pieces one day.

A beginner's course in silversmithing and soldering got me hooked right away (so much so, that I asked my friend's sister, who was a jewellery student at the time, if we could make some jewellery together! - I am thankful for her time to this day). In 2018, I moved to Barcelona and decided to join a local jewellery studio. Every Monday evening, I explored different techniques, building my skills bit by bit. It was here that I discovered my favourite technique: wax carving—a wonderfully peaceful and rewarding craft.

Having spent years in the events industry, the pandemic's arrival in 2020 gave me an unexpected chance to turn my hobby into something more. I launched Juno Jewellery, focusing on bespoke pieces that I mainly created through wax carving. Working from my tiny home studio with just a handful of tools taught me something important: you don't need a fancy setup to create beautiful wax-carved jewellery—just a table, a chair, and a few basic tools.

After the pandemic, I went back to managing events full-time but kept Juno Jewellery going for commission pieces. While organising away days and seasonal parties for corporate clients, I noticed something: we were all a bit tired of the usual team-building activities. Pottery classes, cooking workshops, candle-making and escape rooms—we'd all done them countless times. That's when it hit me: jewellery making could offer something fresh and different. It's a chance for teams to get creative, focus on the details, boost their confidence and make something truly personal they can wear or gift. Plus, there's nothing quite like the feeling of pride when you finish making your very own piece of jewellery!

## Sustainability & ethics

All jewellery made at our workshops is cast in recycled silver at local casting studios. We then polish and finish each piece by hand at our studio.


## Location

We can bring our jewellery making workshops to your space, co-working, event venue or reatreat location. If you don’t have a location but would still like to hire our services, we would reccomend hiring a space that meets the requirements; a table, chairs for all participants and good lighting!

## FAQ

### Safety & Insurance

We take your safety seriously! We hold a Level 2 Health & Safety in the Workplace certificate and Professional Liability Insurance (which we're happy to share with you). While wax carving is a safe activity, we recommend having a first aider either in the building or participating in the workshop for added peace of mind.

### Venue Requirements

All you need to provide is:

- A well-lit room
- Tables and chairs for all participants
- Approximately 24 inches of workspace per person for comfortable creating

### Group Sizes & Sessions

We want to ensure everyone gets the attention they deserve! For groups of 10 or more, we provide an additional jeweller to give you the best possible experience. Don't have space for everyone at once? No problem! We can either:

- Split the group across different rooms
- Arrange multiple sessions to accommodate your entire team

### The magic number for our workshops:

- Minimum: 6 participants for ring carving
- Maximum: 10 participants per jeweller

### Drinking alcohol

Yes, you can enjoy a drink while creating! We simply ask that participants limit themselves to one alcoholic beverage to ensure everyone can create their best work safely.

### Clean-Up

Leave the cleaning to us! We'll take care of everything after the workshop. We just ask that you book the room for an extra 20 minutes so we can return the space to its original condition
